<h1 id="a-guide-to-the-blind-date-mask-.">.: A Guide To The Blind Date Mask :.</h1>
<p>Do you have that secret <em>kink</em> that your - otherwise perfect - SL significant other is not interested in exploring with you?</p>
<p>Are you a <em>couple</em> that would like to take the plunge and explore the feelings that come from interaction with strangers?</p>
<p>Are you a <em>single</em> up to no good, and just want to enjoy a joyful wild time, no-string-attached, without populating your friend list with strangers that you will hardly remember?</p>
<p>Are you attracted by the primal excitation of <em>public and promiscuous</em> group sex?</p>
<p>Are you just in the mood of <em>watching</em>, enjoying the murmurs and the sight of others giving and receiving pleasure?</p>
<p>And, above all, would you like to enjoy all this while staying <em>anonymous</em>, playing with your rich and detailed avatar, without the need and to hide yourself behind alts?</p>
<p>The <em>Blind Date Mask</em> (BDM for short) allows you and all the other participants to experience a wild, limitless, and fully anonymous experience.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-do-.">.: What you need to do :.</h2>
<p>To use our mask, you will need a few things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>an RLV-capable viewer, such as Firestorm, as the standard SL Viewer does not support RLV, which is how the Mask alters your in-world perception.The Firestorm viewer can be downloaded for free <a href="https://www.firestormviewer.org/os/">here</a></p></li>
<li><p>Once you have Firestorm downloaded, RLVa must be enabled. This can be found in Preferences &gt; Firestorm &gt; Extras and is the top option (Allow Remote Scripted Viewer Controls (RLVa). Once you have that ticked, you will need to restart Firestorm to enable RLVa to kick in. You will know it's worked as there will be a new Tab (RLVa) on your top menu.</p></li>
<li><p>an RLV Relay. If you don't have one, there is a free relay included in the gift boxes at Blind Date. You can also grab it from this <a href="https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/CM-Hardcore-RLV-Relay/5165160">link</a>. Once you have this, ADD it from your inventory. It is a HUD which sits in the bottom left corner of your screen (movable for convenience) and it has three colours (Red, Amber and Green), selectable by clicking. It should be the GREEN option. If you are using your own Relay, it should be set to Auto-Accept.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, choose a coloured mask (to match your outfit) and <em>ADD</em> it to your inventory.The Masks are available in a gift box at the Club entrance and are free to Group Members. You must have your Group Tag active to receive the Mask. In order to preserve your anonymity, you should wear the mask at home or in some other script-enabled sim (look at the icons on the left of the address bar: if you see the &quot;no script&quot; icon, the mask will not initialise).</p></li>
<li><p>As soon as you <em>ADD</em> the mask, you will be immediately transported from wherever you are on the Grid to the Dark Room so make sure you're properly dressed before adding!!!</p></li>
<li><p>To take off the mask, just <em>TOUCH</em> it. You simply can't detach it in the normal way. This allows you to swiftly change outfits (or get naked) using your pre-defined sets, without accidentally losing the mask. You'll be immediately teleported to the place where you put on the mask, and nobody will be able to follow or track you.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The mask works in a simple way: the wearer cannot see the names of the other people around them, nor their profiles, nor can they establish IM chats with those around them. Otherwise, the wearer's vision is not impeded nor filtered. This implies that, if you are the only one wearing the mask, the others can see your name, browse your profile, and IM you. Therefore, everybody in the room has to wear a mask. Then, be warned: if you are not wearing the Mask you will be teleported out! The Dark Room is Mask Access Only! <em>Trying to cheat means ejection and a ban. No money back</em>.</p>
<p>Also, consider that HUDs, collars, cum systems, pregnancy devices, and the like can cause minor leaks of your identity. We know that they are so much fun, so just use them sparingly and consider putting them on silent mode, if available. Giving or receiving objects from other people around you can also disclose your identity by automatically opening an IM window.</p>
<p><em>No IMs, friendship requests, or stalking are allowed using names, UIIDs or whatever could be obtained from MamaAllpas, It'sNotMines, or the like. The use of any data leak from any source is severely forbidden and may result in a ban</em>.</p>
<p>We hope you find this event enjoyable and we have gone to a lot of effort to provide the <em>experience</em> to enjoy it. Any feedback - good or bad - would be appreciated! If you have any issues with the set-up process, please feel free to contact anyone in the Management team and we will do our best to assist you.</p>
<p>Many thanks for reading and being part of the best experience in SL.</p>
<h2 id="faqs-.">.: FAQs :.</h2>
<p>.: <em>Where do I find the mask?</em> The mask can be found at the Club landing point or in the Club main room, under the cage hanging from the ceiling. Please grab your mask before the event, since you will not be able to stay on the premises without it if the event is running.</p>
<p>.: <em>How can I understand who's speaking? The names are just generic.</em> The mask replaces everyone's name tag, so it is hard to understand who's saying what in a chat window. We strongly advise you to set up the bubble chat in your Firestorm preferences (Chat &gt; Visuals &gt; Show chat in bubbles above avatars). That gives a more precise feeling about the location of the speaker.</p>
<p>.: <em>What if I'd like to talk more privately with this hot stranger?</em> Since IMs are blocked, you can hang with your partner in a remote corner, and use the &quot;whisper&quot; function (Shift+enter after typing your sentence in the public chat window). Whispers are audible only within a 10 metre radius from the speaker, while regular chat has a 20 metre radius. That means that your whispers can be heard just by your partner, or by the group you are in (you know what I mean, do you?).</p>
<p>.: <em>Oh my, I really like this stranger! How can we meet?</em> The purpose of the Blind Date is to let people meet, and set them free to behave in accordance with their deepest desires. What happens next is up to you, so be inventive! Upon mutual consent, you can disclose your names and, to this end, you can get some hints by carefully reading the previous text. You can send an object, triggering an IM; go to a far corner and whisper your names (isn't it romantic? ); or simply wait until the event is over and then remove your masks. These are just a few suggestions, but the possibilities are limitless; try to surprise your new partner! But, again, mutual consent is paramount. Stalking people to get their names will result in ejection and a ban (and again, no group fee will be refunded).</p>
