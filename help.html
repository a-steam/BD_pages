<p>In our effort to improve the Blind Date experience, we recently introduced several new features.</p>
<p>Gerard the bot is now speaking in the group chat after Kety's effort to overcome his natural shyness. Gerard is leading us into a new age of services that will transform the way we communicate.</p>
<p>We also built a secret room only accessible to those wearing our mask, to turn our <em>anonymous events</em> into a continuing experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-dark-room-.">.: The Dark Room :. <a name="DR"></a></h2>
<p>You can access the <em>Dark Room</em> just by wearing our mask.</p>
<p>The mask will <em>hide your name and profile</em> and you will not be able to send IMs to other people wearing the mask (the IM sessions you started will remain active, though).</p>
<p>As soon as you wear the mask, you will be immediately teleported to the new room, where you can enjoy the company of other anonymous guests.</p>
<p>Please note that in order to bring you to the new location, the mask has changed. You should therefore <em>grab the new mask</em> at the club entrance! For further information about the mask, please check the section <a href="https://a-steam.github.io/BD_pages/BD_mask.html">About the Mask</a></p>
<p>What if the room is empty? Well, here comes into play the next exciting feature: the Blind Date Button!</p>
<h2 id="the-blind-date-button-is-your-new-date-night-game-changer-.">.: The Blind Date Button is your new date-night game changer :. <a name="BDB"></a></h2>
<p>This group has 2000 members, and they want to meet each other. In order to help members out, we invented the <em>Blind Date Button</em> One button is located under the balcony, near the stairs. Another one is in the Dark Room. There are slight differences between the two.</p>
<p>The BDB (Blind Date Button) allows Gerard to see when you are looking for a date. He will ask in the group chat if anyone is interested.</p>
<p>If you click on the BDB (Blind Date Button) in the <em>Club</em>, Gerard will send a very brief message to anyone who is available: <em>&quot;Mrs./Mr. Blind Dater would like to meet someone to have an amazingly good time. Please come and meet her/him.&quot;</em></p>
<p>If you click on the BDB in the *Dark Room, Gerard will not say your name and will tell you that you are waiting for your date in the Dark Room.</p>
<p>You can be more precise by clicking on three buttons: to specify who you would like to meet, what you would like to do with them, and whether you want Gerard to say your name (disabled in the Dark Room).</p>
<p>When you submit a request, it will appear in the group chat. Please check there before you start spamming the Group Chat by repeatedly clicking the button. The final string of your request will appear in the public chat window (but nobody can read it in the public chat, just you!).</p>
<p>If you send your request from the Club and choose not to reveal your identity, keep in mind that your potential partner has no way of knowing who you are. So you need to find a way to let them know! Sitting idle will do nothing for you. As a rule of thumb, after issuing a request, check the club entrance for some time. Similarly, if you respond to a request, take a look at the people close to the BDB.</p>
<h2 id="faqs-.">.: FAQs :. <a name="FAQs"></a></h2>
<p>.: <em>Where is the Dark Room? I can't seem to find it! </em>To better protect the privacy of our users, the Dark Room location is unknown. You can just access it by wearing the mask. That will automatically teleport you there.</p>
<p>I'm not seeing any feedback from the BDB!</p>
<p>Please look closer at the public chat. For some reason, IMs sent by objects appear in the public chart window in a different colour. Green is the default in most browsers, but it depends on your settings.</p>
<p>.: <em>How do I know that Gerard sent my request?</em></p>
<p>Just look in the group chat window! If there is a very recent request or a request with your name, it is yours!</p>
<p>Gerard sent my request, but nobody came in! -- In spite of the high number of group members, it could happen. What we noticed during the test, though, is that people responding to anonymous requests have no clue about the person that issued them, so they tend to idle at the entrance, while the sender stays idle close to the bar, complaining that nobody comes in. Again, after issuing a request, please check the club entrance for some time. If you respond to a request, please have a look at the people close to the BDB.</p>
<p>.: <em>How does the BDB know if I'm a Mrs. or a Mr.?</em></p>
<p>The button performs an automatic gender detection based on the avatar shape. If you like shape-shifting, choose the right avatar before pressing the button!</p>
